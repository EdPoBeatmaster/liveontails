I am grateful to be a part of this community officially now that I have used your resources for years.  I am only significant in that I have discovered multiple 0-day vuinerabilties amongs the various linux distros.  I hope to learn very much from you while I am here.  Thank you for accepting me as a part of your community.  liveontaails
